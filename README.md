## Description

We have created an end to end optimized supply chain:

- Problem 1: We explore the challenge of allocating production demand across various facilities while minimizing the costs ensuring that the demand is met. (Mixed Integer programming)

 - Problem 2: We design an optimal transportation route to improve operational efficiency while minimizing the distance. (Traveling Salesman Problem)
